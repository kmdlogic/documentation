# Logic

![logic logo](/images/logo_black.png)

Logic is an integration and orchestration platform with big plans. It's initial audience is KMD products wishing to expose all or part of their API to a managed set of subscribers. At it's heart it will leverage a series of Microsoft Azure offerings but these will be configured and managed in a way to create a cohesive platform.

Over time the use cases for the platform is expected to expand to:

* presenting a unified graph interface
* common identity management
* offering API management to external (i.e. non-KMD) products
* consuming public APIs for coordinated use

## Getting started

To  get started with Logic, the simplest thing to do is simply to go the Logic [console](https://console.kmdlogic.io), login and create a subscription.

Now you'll be set to start consume services. You can explore the different services provided by the Logic team by looking through the navigation on the left.

Logic also enables teams outside the Logic team to expose their services (if you want to know how go [here](#providers)). If you want to explore services by other providers navigate to the Marketplace.

## Providers

As a provider to logic you can take advantage of the advanced service infrastructure we already operate, like identity/access management, logging and auditing or you can also just choose to expose your existing API's as is on the Logic Marketplace. If you want to learn more about how to get started as a provider [this](./providers/getting-started.md) article will take you through a step by step guide on getting setup and approved as a provider. To learn more about submitting API's to the Marketplace, go [here](./providers/register-an-api.md). General information for providers is available [here](./providers/readme.md)

## Services

Logic has a marketplace with a list of useful services that you can rely on to build applications.  

Please refer to our documentation for further information [here](./services/README.md).
